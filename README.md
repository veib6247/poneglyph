# Poneglyph

So you know when you're on Reddit, and you're scrolling down your usual H sub. And then you see this "art", and they put the sauce in the comments but they don't tell you which site it's for (although it's almost always for NH, but sometimes it isn't). Yeah, that's what this thing is for.

Formats your magic numbers into clickable links that you can go to, or copy to share.

This is NSFW btw (in case it wasn't clear yet, lol).
